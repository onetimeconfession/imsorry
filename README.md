Hi there you know who I am. Of course I have my part and this will be my parting messages. I'll do it the programmer way so that you don't feel I am copying you. This will have a lot of section because that's just how much I want to tell you.

## Reaction

So this section will be my reaction to your "alasan.pdf". To be honest, yesterday I was waiting and I thought you need more time to write your reasons down. But that night I was still awake because I just finished playing games with my friend. I was about to sleep when your notification pop up and I know what it's all about.

When I reach the end of the first page I know it's coming. You may be don't know because I never tell you, but I know and I can sense whether you lose interest in me. Almost very obvious because I know how you react. I always ask whether I'm disturbing or not and you always reply with "No you don't", but in my heart I know I do disturb you.

Second page just hit home. The tiktok one in particular. You know, since that incident on October (you know what I'm talking about) I question myself. Is that was the correct thing to do, because I think that was in THAT situation. I had to agree, my lust got the better of me, rather got the better of us. I could have stopped that, but regret will do no good anymore. There's no way I put all the blame on you. WE build this relationship and with the same way of thinking we have responsiblity of it.

You might think I'm lying but I never think there's no future between us. I ALWAYS hope for a future between us. Then you'll definitely ask "Why did you say such thing? Whoever my husband would be instead of when you are my husband or something". In my heart, I feel that saying "When I am your husband in the future" it will hurt you, because someday (which just happen) I will leave you again. I also feel that you'll think that thing is cringe and does not fit the situation in any sense.

But the part you say our relationship is toxic just literally killed me. I can't believe I got to another toxic relationship. Like holy shit I'm bad at this. No matter how healthy it started, it will turn into the toxic one in the end. That always happen and I don't know what to do, I tried to avoid it but it just happen anyways. Though surprisingly, I'm not as angry or mad or whatever. Well I can't sleep last night to be fair but oh well. I'm quite prepared for this. I did say "Biar ada yang selesai, entah itu masalah ini atau yang lain" you know what it refers to.

Last page nothing hinders me. Some of your words did annoy me not gonna lie. But I don't want to see myself raging at you in any point in my life. You had pure intentions, you want yourself a male friend to talk to. Nothing wrong. Nothing. Wrong. But I took this in a different turn and we stray so far away from the road we should have taken. I can't believe this happen twice in my life, with the same person.

I grant you your wish. No more us. This is definitely the best for now. I hurt you more than enough. You should be free. Maybe I shouldn't have existed in your life anyways. Wasting your time and energy for me. A pathethic living creature. I did invite a huge number of pity from people. I'll stop now. Sadly, my death wouldn't be helping you in any way possible. Below this I include more section for more things I want to talk/explain. I hope you finish this to the end

## Thin Line Between Love and Lust

Funny, I used to listen a japanese song about this. A girl fell in love with a boy and they started a relationship. They reached a point of no return (unlike us, which I'm very grateful about). They cannot differ a lust from love. The line went blur and they ended up doing it. Even worse, the boy left the girl alone. Finally, the girl started another relationship with other boy and end up in the same place as before.

You know, after the October incident I still feel that's the correct act to do. I'm not gonna lie, I was happy that happened. Never in my life would I imagine that really happen to me before marriage. I'll be frontal okay so please prepare your heart. When we get to do that, I'm just addicted. Like, I know you will grant my wish as long it doesn't cross the last line. Which you did, I always ask whether you okay with it or not and you know what you said. Things escalated quickly over months and one by one your firsts are taken. I'm sorry. I couldn't protect your honor (kehormatan). I'm just worst, moreover I was happy it all happened.

During those months, I started to worry. I feel that this relationship took a wrong turn. It is lust-driven. I'm worst. I literally vent my lust and imagination to you. Although I know that's wrong, I keep on doing it for evertime I went to visit your house. I just want to satisfy my lust. At that point I don't care because I'm a jerk. I'm an animal. A monkey in lust. With the way you act, I never really stop to think how you feel. I want to apologise to your mother as well for not being able to protect her daughter. I just corrupt you and probably dragging you all the way to hell. I'm worst.

## I'm Playing Villain

You said you don't want to be the evil one this time. You also said that everything happen with pure intention. Alright, I'll take the lead. You can insult me however you like if that will make you feel better. I took advantage of our situation so I can vent my lust and indulge in sexual activities. You actually resist and against it but I'm just forcing my will and did it without regret. Even at times, I always ask for more. Eventually I found the activities only enjoyed by me. You are definitely being bothered but you can't say it to me.

I'm so selfish. I always think about myself and never about you. All I want is you to reply my messages like at the beginning. More than once did I rage at you for not doing so. For ignoring my message, leaving it rotten until I'm confronting you. You were just busy doing your best at your life, and here I am forcing my selfish desire onto you. I'm just that insensitive to your signals. You are burdened with your feeling of not hurting me in any way.

This section is yours to reply. I will be waiting.

## Your 2 times ex-boyfriend

You know, I never wish this to be happen. I feel that we got the hang of it. A second chance, to fix what is wrong. To stay even longer until the next step. That's why I cherish every single moment of us together. I don't want to regret anything. You may be the last ex-girlfriend I will have before marriage. The moment we spend together is not a waste (*I'm tearing up here). I could never do that to someone I love with all I have. I tried to be nice, tried to stay calm, tried to satisfy you, tried to fulfill your needs. But, it appears that all is not enough. I did not meet your expectation. I'm really sad to see you go again. No one can compare you.

I'm just not strong enough. Unlike you. Whenever I look at you, I feel so small. I'm just not at your level. You are shining brightly. When you were away in Jogja, I feel sad. You got 4 of the best people Allah picked just for you as friends. Sure, I don't know them as close as you are. But everytime I see you with them, you are happy. No, you find joy. I think that joy is something different from happiness. I read that joy come internally while happiness come externally. Whenever I see you smile in a picture with them, I feel lost, left behind, envy. There is no way I can do that. The happiness I bring is different from what they do. At that point too I realize, I am no longer needed.

That is a question I always want to ask. In a relationship, that one question is just a time ticking bomb. You can ask it directly and the bomb exploded. Some people find it offensive because it may sound like they lose trust in their partner. That's how I think. I don't want to ask you because you'll think that I lose my trust in you. But then again, how you act, how you reply, and your choice of words kinda reflect it. November and so on, I feel that I'm not needed. I should just go, but I can't. I believe that this is the one, I had to endure and you will need me again. But in the end, here we are.

## What's left from me

I want to stay true to myself. I don't want to lose you again, ever. So here I am, as responsive as I am. I want to promise you something I will keep as long as I'm alive. I will be here, for you as friend. No less, no more. I will help you as long as I can. I will **ngobrol** for as long and as much as you like if that's what you want.

Again, I'm sorry for letting you down. I'm sorry that I will not regret good and bad things we did while we were together. I appreciate everthing you do and I genuinely love you though this doesn't matter anymore. I forgive you, even if you don't apologise I will still do. I only hope that you don't block me in any way. That's the only thing I fear. I'm sorry I can't give you a proper good bye. I want to stay in contact with you, stay in good terms though it's different from when we were together.

Thank you for everything, I wish you forgiveness and all the good things from here on. You are such a strong girl living in this world, nothing can stay in your way. I will be watching, and praying for your success. Feel free to reply, I really want to know what you think.

Sayonara,  
Abim
